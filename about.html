<p><b>Hello! I’m Harinee, a passionate food enthusiast and aspiring web developer.</b></p>
<p> This space is my creative blend of delicious recipes and design — where I bring tasty ideas to life using just HTML and CSS.
it’s a rich chocolate cake, a refreshing milkshake, or simple home-style meals, I love sharing recipes that are easy to follow and full of flavor. Every dish here is crafted with care, aiming to inspire both beginners and seasoned cooks alike.

When I’m not cooking or coding, you’ll find me exploring new flavors, learning new skills, or refining the little details that make every plate (and page) look perfect.</p>

<p>Thank you for visiting my site — I hope it brings joy to your screen and your kitchen! </p>
